Step 6: Event-level Causal Analysis              ✗ FAILED     (0.0s vs 600s estimated)
Step 7: Enhanced Well-level Analysis with CI     ✗ FAILED     (0.0s vs 900s estimated)
Step 8: Enhanced Event-level Analysis with CI    ✗ FAILED     (0.0s vs 720s estimated)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Injection volume causes seismic activity through two mechanisms
- Near-field (≤5km): Mixed direct mechanical and pressure-mediated effects
- Far-field (>10km): Exclusively pressure-mediated effects
- Strongest effects: 3-4km radius shows 20× stronger effects than 20km
- Optimal monitoring: 5-7km radius balances effect size and predictive accuracy
- Policy implication: Spatially-targeted regulation within 7km of faults recommended
