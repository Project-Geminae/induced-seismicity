DoWhy Event-Level Mediation Analysis - Methodology Notes
============================================================

DATA AGGREGATION:
- Raw data aggregated by EventID (earthquake events)
- Injection volumes: summed across wells per event
- Injection pressure: median across wells per event
- Fault distance: minimum across wells per event
- Fault segments: summed across wells per event
- Well count: number of wells per event (added as confounder)

CAUSAL MODEL:
- Treatment (W): Total injection volume per event
- Mediator (P): Median injection pressure per event
- Outcome (S): Earthquake magnitude
- Confounders: G1 (fault distance), G2 (fault segments), well_count

DOWHY FRAMEWORK:
- Explicit causal DAG with backdoor adjustment
- Bootstrap confidence intervals (50 iterations)
- Refutation tests: placebo, subset, random confounder
- Dual RÂ² metrics: causal (linear) and predictive (log-transformed)

QUALITY METRICS:
- Average bootstrap success rate: 100.0%
- Average VIF (multicollinearity): 3.72
- Refutation tests passed: 19/20 (95.0%)
